# Î¤witter clone

Trying to make a simple clone for our lovely social platform Twitter while using basic HTML,CSS,JS markup. 

I also used Bootstrap framework to practice my skills.

## How to install

1. If you use xampp just clone the repository to your local machine in the folder ./htdocs/
2. You can also use live server to host the site.

## Development

If you want to commit changes to this repository you can open a PR in the <strong> dev branch </strong> with the below structure:

- For additions, branch names are `new/description-of-addition`.
- For fixes, `fix/description-of-fix`.
- For changes, `change/description-of-change`.
